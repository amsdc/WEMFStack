# WEMFStack
Windows/nginx/Mariadb(mysql)/Flask(Python) stack for development as well as production (in local area network). Created for running RMS Backend.

# Update
The maintainers of this repository have decided not to develop this tool. This is because many other similar tools already exist, and the Flask development mode is sufficient for testing purposes.

If you are interested in working on this project, please do contact the maintainers at amsdc.webmaster@gmail.com
